## GitHub Contribution Workflow

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone down the repo to your local system.

``` 
git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/bootcamp.git
```

3. Add the upstream repo. (You only have to do this once, not every time.)

``` 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cloudberrydb/bootcamp.git
```

4. Create a new branch to hold your work.

``` 
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

5. Work on your new code. 
6. Commit your changes.

``` 
git add <the change files> 
git commit
```

7. Push your changes to your GitHub repo.

```
git push origin new-branch-name
```

8. Open a PR (Pull Request).

Go to the repo on GitHub. There will be a message about your recently pushed
branch, asking if you would like to open a pull request. Follow the prompts,
compare across repositories, and submit the PR.

9. Get your code reviewed.
10. Congratulations! Once your PR is approved, and passes the CI/CD without
errors, then the code will be merged. Your code will be shipped in the recent
future releases.

## Sync your branch with the upstream

Before working on your next contribution, make sure your local repository is
up to date:

```
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```
